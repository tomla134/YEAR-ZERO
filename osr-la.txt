Unbelievable, the quality of stuff you have been sending in.  Check out=
 the new content on the site-and beyond that, people are starting to submit=
 platforms with real potential.  From campus DJs and copy store clerks to=
 people with connections at major networks and publications.  This feels=
 like the start of something real.  (I'll be sending out the first few connections=
 soon, so please keep them coming.  Every voice out here helps.) =0D=0A=
 =0D=0ALocal news-some very serious artists in LA are making a difference=
 in a very public place.  Check out the piece near Melrose and Ogden in=
 LA.  If you're worried about where this country (and this world) is going,=
 check out their work.  It will remind you why you should be worried:  but=
 maybe give you a little juice for the fight, too.=0D=0A =0D=0ALastly, a=
 few of us are talking about organizing a meeting here in LA.  If you're=
 interested, show up at the Melrose location at or a little after 7 pm on=
 this Friday evening (April 13th).  Wear something that shows you're one=
 of us.  Stand under the big pig and follow the revolver across the street=
 to the van.  Knock twice.  When you've got the stuff, get out of there=
 fast.  Don't attract attention.  Don't be followed.=0D=0A =0D=0AThat's=
 it for now.  Sometimes it feels like hope is hard to come by.  What you're=
 doing makes hope a little easier for me to find.=0D=0A =0D=0ANeil=0D=0A=
